    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This chicken stir fry is about as easy as it gets. It begins with some
        cubed chicken breast, although chicken thighs can also work well. I like to start
        with the chicken when I'm making a stir fry because as they brown, they create a layer
        of flavor in the skillet.
