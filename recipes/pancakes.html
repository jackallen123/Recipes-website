        Looking for the <em>perfect</em> pancake recipe? Your search ends here. Made from
        a simple batter of flour, milk, eggs, and baking powder, there's a reason
        these are a favorite amongst my family! These are <strong>everything</strong> that you want
        from pancakes: light and fluffy with crispy edges, perfect for soaking up
        pools of melted butter and maple syrup.

    <h1>How to make it!</h1>

    <h4>Prep time: 10 minutes</h4>
    <h4>Cook time: 25 minutes</h4>
    <h4>Total time: 35 minutes</h4>
    <h4>Servings: 3-4</h4>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 c.</strong> all-purpose flour</li>
        <li><strong>1 tbsp.</strong> granulated sugar</li>
        <li><strong>2 tsp.</strong> baking powder</li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp.</strong> kosher salt</li>
        <li><strong>1 1/3 c.</strong> whole milk</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> large egg</li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp.</strong> pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li><strong>2 tbsp.</strong> melted unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl, whisk milk, egg, and vanilla. While whisking, stream in melted butter and whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Gently fold dry ingredients into milk mixture until just combined (do not overmix; some lumps are okay).</li>
        <li>Preheat a griddle or other large heavy skillet over medium heat until hot but not scorching, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt enough butter to cover surface of griddle, then pour about 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Cook pancake until bubbles form on top and sides start to lift from pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until bottom is golden brown and pancake is fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack. Wipe off griddle, then repeat with more butter and remaining batter (you should get about 10 pancakes). </li>
        <li>Divide pancakes among plates. Serve with butter and syrup.</li>
